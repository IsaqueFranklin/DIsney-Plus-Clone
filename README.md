A very nice partial functional Disney+ clone with React and Firebase.

To see it just clone the repository and install by npm or yarn the following dependeces:

- @reduxjs/toolkit
- react-router-dom
- styled-components
- firebase
- slick-carousel
- react-slick

Maybe I'm forgetting something but the terminal will let you now. âŒ‚

And don't forget to set your firebase account.
